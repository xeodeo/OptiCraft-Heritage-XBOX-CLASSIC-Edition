// ---- Pass-0 mesh reordering (face buckets + atlas tile grouping) ----
//
// Measured 2026-07-28 in the [PS2] draw stats: of ~4000 triangle-equivalents
// pushed through the transform each frame only 617 reach the GS, and the batch
// health line reported quadsPerFlush=12 against a 32 maximum with
// clampSet=2894 tracking stripFlush=2900 one for one -- i.e. EVERY strip packet
// was being cut short by a texture-clamp change, because the per-block
// RenderBlocks path emits quads in block-scan order and consecutive quads
// almost never share an atlas cell.
//
// PS2_MESH_FACE_SORT reorders a finished opaque section mesh once, at build
// completion, into:
//     atlas tile (the 16x16 cell ps2_select_clamp keys REGION_REPEAT on)
//       -> bucket (face direction: +X -X +Y -Y +Z -Z, then "other")
//         -> 8x8x8 spatial cluster
//
// It moves whole quads only, so nothing about the geometry changes; pass 0 is
// opaque and depth-tested, so draw order is free. Pass 1 (water/ice/glass) is
// deliberately NOT reordered -- blending needs its back-to-front order.
//
// Compact range metadata retains both the face bucket and exact cluster AABB.
// PS2_FACE_BUCKET_CULL then uses the buckets at draw time: every terrain face
// is axis-aligned, so a +Y bucket whose lowest face sits above the eye is 100%
// backfacing and can be dropped with ONE float compare instead of 4 VU0
// transforms + 4 reciprocals + 4 projections + a signed-area test per quad.
//
// The two are separate knobs on purpose. The reorder is a pure win and cannot
// change what is drawn; the cull depends on the sign convention of the outward
// normal (derived from (p1-p0)x(p2-p0), verified against RenderBlocks::
// renderTopFace/renderBottomFace). If terrain ever renders inside-out, set
// PS2_FACE_BUCKET_CULL to 0 first -- that isolates the sign from the reorder.
#define PS2_MESH_FACE_SORT 1
#define PS2_FACE_BUCKET_CULL 1

// Spatial subdivision used by the opaque terrain mesh cache. Four cells per
// axis produce 64 4x4x4 clusters in a 16-block WorldRenderer section. The finer
// bounds let many edge sections keep their interior geometry on direct VU1 while
// only the actually intersecting clusters fall back to clipped VU0. The sorter
// keeps exact geometry bounds, so faces crossing a cell boundary remain
// conservative and cannot be clipped incorrectly.
#define PS2_MESH_CLUSTER_AXIS 4

// Direct VIF1/VU1/XGKICK terrain is enabled only when the optional VU1 backend
// is compiled (the stats build). It handles opaque terrain directly; the fast
// entry consumes fully-inside clusters and the optional clipped entry consumes
// partial/near clusters. VU0 remains the fallback and handles all translucent
// terrain. The original BASE/OFFSET/TOPS feed produced missing
// chunks on hardware, so the current A/B uses explicit ping-pong addresses and
// ITOP instead. The normal PS2 build disables the VU1 backend in CMake and
// therefore retains the production VU0 path without the extra SoA mesh.
#define PS2_DIRECT_VU1_TERRAIN 1

// Diagnostic-only VU1 canary. When the VU1 terrain backend is compiled, draw
// one fixed magenta quad after the translucent terrain pass through an
// absolute-address VIF1 upload and a single XGKICK. It deliberately avoids the
// terrain MVP, texture, fog, ADC strip restarts and VIF TOPS double buffering,
// so its visibility isolates the base VIF1 -> VU1 -> GIF Path1 -> GS contract.
// Set this to 1 only when isolating the base Path1 contract. The explicit-buffer
// terrain A/B below keeps it disabled so the overlay and its per-frame barriers
// do not contaminate performance measurements.
#define PS2_VU1_TERRAIN_CANARY 0

// A cluster can intersect the visible frustum while still fitting entirely
// inside the wider GS XY guard band. Those clusters need no clipping at all:
// classifyClusterGuardRisk proves, for the whole cluster AABB, that w >= the
// near epsilon and that |x| <= gx*w and |y| <= gy*w, so every vertex projects
// inside the guard band by construction and the GS scissor finishes the job.
//
// This is the single largest lever in the port. Measured 2026-08-27, standing
// still with the world loaded, per frame:
//     pass0            36.5 ms   (77% of a 47.3 ms render, in a 62 ms EE frame)
//     VU1              21948 vertices, 335 batches, 0.009 ms of wait
//     VU0/EE           15232 vertices
//     guardSafePartial 158 clusters / 15796 vertices
// guardSafePartial and vu0Verts agree to within 4%: essentially ALL the terrain
// the EE still transforms is guard-safe partial clusters held back by this
// switch alone, and the VU1 it would move them to is idle 99.99% of the frame.
// The EE side of that geometry measured 10.3 ms of counted xform/project/emit
// plus an uncounted remainder dominated by the 244 KB/frame gather memcpy that
// feeds it through an 8 KB D-cache.
//
// The first attempt at this produced cluster-sized terrain holes at screen
// edges and the switch was turned off. The suspected mechanism is not the
// classification but FTOI4: the EE paths clamp XY through gsKit's
// __gsKit_float_to_int_xy, the microprogram did not, and an out-of-range vertex
// therefore WRAPPED in the 16-bit XY field instead of clamping -- which, with
// ADC strip restarts, loses a whole strip rather than one quad. Ps2Vu1Terrain.vsm
// now applies that bound itself (MAXx/MINIw before FTOI4.xy), so a
// classification error can only stretch a primitive, not delete a cluster.
//
// That mechanism is a hypothesis until this runs on hardware. If the holes come
// back, set this to 0 -- that restores the previous behaviour exactly and the
// clamp is inert -- and the next thing to check is whether the cluster bounds
// and the guard planes are built in the same space, since the planes come from
// the translated MVP in ps2_renderer_prepare_translated_context.
//
// Watch in the [PS2] terrain clusters line: vu0Verts should fall to near zero
// and vu1Verts absorb it. Note also that the fast VU1 entry does no backface
// culling and no offscreen reject, both of which the EE path was doing per
// quad: of the 4102 quads/frame it used to transform only 1655 reached the GS.
// So the moved geometry arrives at the GS ~2.5x over, which is about +34% of
// total terrain primitives (7142 -> 9589 quads/frame at the measurement above).
// Face-bucket culling still applies at range granularity. GS wait was vblank
// rather than fill, so there should be room -- but that is the number to read
// if the frame does not improve as much as the EE saving predicts.
#define PS2_VU1_GUARD_BAND_PARTIALS 1

// Side-only partials are safe to clip on the existing VU1 clipped entry as
// long as the cluster is already proven fully in front of BOTH near hazards:
// the homogeneous OpenGL near plane (z + w >= 0) and the divide guard
// (w >= PS2_NEAR_CLIP_W). The clipped entry handles only w + left/right/
// down/up guard planes, so near/mixed-risk clusters must stay on VU0.
//
// This is intentionally separate from PS2_VU1_CLIPPED_PARTIALS: enabling the
// latter would make the clipped entry authoritative for near-plane geometry,
// which it does not currently clip correctly.
#define PS2_VU1_SIDE_CLIPPED_PARTIALS 0

// Classify cluster AABBs against the frustum and guard band on COP2 (VU0 macro
// mode) instead of the scalar FPU. See Ps2Vu0Math.h for the transposed plane
// layout the kernel needs.
//
// This is the densest block of per-frame float work left outside the emitters:
// every cluster is tested against six frustum planes plus six near/side guard
// planes, at PS2_MESH_CLUSTER_COUNT clusters per section and up to
// PS2_MAX_RENDERED_SECTIONS_PER_PASS sections per pass. The scalar form also
// recomputes the cluster centre and extent once per plane and takes three fabsf
// per plane per cluster; both are hoisted out by the transposed block, which is
// built once per frame.
//
// The arithmetic is the same expression in the same order, but VU0 floats are
// not IEEE-754 (denormals flush to zero, overflow clamps instead of producing an
// infinity), so a grazing cluster can in principle land on the other side of
// kClusterPlaneEpsilon. Turn this off first if terrain starts stretching or
// disappearing at screen edges: a misclassified guard risk is exactly the
// failure PS2_VU1_GUARD_BAND_PARTIALS documents, and 0 restores the scalar
// classifier bit for bit.

// allowing a missing VU1 packet to open a terrain hole. The first runtime
// probe submitted every batch successfully, but exposed invalid terrain/depth

// the bounding box downward from posY by yOffset (1.62 for a player), so posY sits
// at eye level and the first-person test is exact.
//
// Third person is not: EntityRenderer::orientCamera pulls the camera up to
// thirdPersonDistance (4.0) back along the view vector inside the modelview
// matrix, and nothing outside that function sees the offset. Without a margin,
// a bucket could be dropped while the pulled-back camera can still see it --
// which reads as terrain vanishing when F5 is pressed. 4.0 covers the whole
// third-person arc; the cull only loses power for geometry within 4 blocks of

// The GS texture cache is 8 KB. Sampling a 256x256 atlas at level 0 for a
// section twenty blocks away fetches a fresh page for nearly every quad, and
// the texel-to-pixel ratio there is 2-4:1, which is also what shimmers. Levels
// 1..N are a quarter, a sixteenth... of the level-0 footprint, so the cache
// holds them and the fetch cost drops with distance instead of staying flat.
//
// RenderEngine already builds the chain: ofMipmapLevel > 0 makes setupTexture
// upload levels 1..N through renderTextureImageRgba and TextureFX re-sends the
// animated tiles per level through renderTextureSubImageRgba. This backend used
// to reject anything but level 0; with this on, Ps2Texture keeps the extra
// levels for tile atlases only (PSMT8, sharing the level-0 CLUT) and the two
// native terrain emitters program TEX1/MIPTBP1. Every other draw still goes
// through gsKit primitives, which write a fixed-LOD TEX1 of their own, so the
// GUI, entities and the held item keep sampling level 0 unchanged.
//
// Level selection is TEX1 LCM=0: LOD = log2(1/|Q|) * 2^L + K/16 with Q = 1/w
// from the perspective divide, i.e. LOD = log2(distance in blocks) + K/16. At
// 640x448 and a 70 degree vertical FOV a 16-texel tile covers 320/w pixels, so
// one texel is one pixel at w = 20 blocks. K below is tuned for
// NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST (the GS rounds LOD): level 1 from w = 16, level 2 from
// w = 32, which lands inside the 48-block render window. Raise K toward 0 to
// hold level 0 further out; lower it for a softer far field.
//
// First thing to check on hardware: REGION_REPEAT tiles at distance. The GS
// shifts UMSK/UFIX by LOD for mip levels, which is what keeps a 16x16 tile
// addressed correctly at 8x8 and 4x4; if far terrain shows the wrong tile,

// radius bounded to the resident cache, the spawn cluster's +-6 block spread probes
// into radius-3 (out-of-cache) chunks and force-generates them, plus the per-chunk
// biome lookup is costly. On a 32 MB budget mobs are unaffordable for now; re-enable
// with a cheaper spawn path (loaded-chunks-only probes, float biome) once headroom
// allows. See [[ps2-oom-reserve]].
