// ---- VIF1 submission primitives shared by every direct-terrain path ----
//
// Both of these exist because the EE behaves differently from every emulator
// this backend was developed against, and getting either one wrong produces the
// same symptom: VIF1 consumes something that is not what the EE wrote, executes
// it, and stops responding.
//
// ps2_vu1_dma_flush_ucab()
//   Every packet below is written through the uncached-accelerated mirror
//   (address | 0x30000000). UCAB stores do not go to memory directly: they
//   accumulate in the EE's 128-byte write-gather buffer, which drains only when
//   a full line is written, when a store crosses into a different line, or on
//   an explicit sync.l. A packet whose last line is partial -- a single-quadword
//   barrier, or the tail of a microprogram upload -- therefore sits in the WGB
//   while the DMAC reads stale memory underneath it. There is no write-gather
//   buffer in PCSX2, which is why this is invisible off-hardware.
//
// ps2_vu1_dma_wait()
//   A bounded replacement for dma_channel_wait(DMA_CHANNEL_VIF1, 0), whose zero
//   timeout means "spin forever". Nothing in this renderer can recover from that
//   and there is no watchdog anywhere, so a single VIF1 or VU1 stall used to
//   hang the console with no output at all. This returns false instead, after
//   printing the VIF1/DMAC state that identifies which of the two stopped.

// or generic-transform path would be another). A backend must not assume its
// own program stays resident once uploaded: whichever program some other
// backend last uploaded is the one VU1 will actually execute. Each backend's
// "did I already upload" check has to go through here instead of a private
// flag, and must re-upload whenever this reports anything other than its own
