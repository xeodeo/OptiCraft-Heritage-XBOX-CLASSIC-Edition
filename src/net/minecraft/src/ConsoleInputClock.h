// world tick, so neither can count ticks, and both need auto-repeat timing while
// a GUI is open.

// Not System::currentTimeMillis(): that rides std::chrono::system_clock, which
// on the PS2 is only as alive as the BIOS timer behind it -- the same source
// that leaves System::nanoTime() sitting still on some revisions. These two are
// the clocks each console's own code already paces itself with.
